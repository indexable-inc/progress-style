# progress-style

The shared [`indicatif`](https://docs.rs/indicatif) progress-bar and spinner
styling for ix command-line tools: one owner for the glyphs, colors, and
templates, so `search`, `dag-runner`, and future commands render the same
shape instead of each hand-rolling a template.

The bar fills one-eighth of a cell at a time with block glyphs over a visible
`░` track (no segmented `=>-` arrow), fronted by a braille spinner:

```text
⠹ indexing 42/128 ███████████▎░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 00:00:07
```

## Quickstart

Pick a style, then set the per-run label and status on the bar:

```rust
use indicatif::ProgressBar;

let bar = ProgressBar::new(128).with_style(progress_style::bar("cyan"));
bar.set_prefix("indexing");
for item in work {
    process(item);
    bar.inc(1);
}
bar.finish();
```

`bar(accent)` is a determinate bar whose fill color marks the phase;
`spinner()` is the matching indeterminate spinner for work with no known
total (label via `set_prefix`, status line via `set_message`).
